Also - pics from Google Earth show he faked a tennis court with a high dirt fence to cover hidden entry to underground pedo tunnels/city - now the 'tennis court' is removed, you can see the structure&hellip;\n",

Through sanctions we have cut off 90 percent of North Korean trade and 30 percent of its oil. \n>But the crude oil remains. \n>The major supplier of that oil is China. \n>In 2003, China actually stopped the oil to North Korea. \n>Soon after, North Korea came to the table. \n>We need China to do more.\n>President Trump called Chinese President Xi this morning \n>And told him that we have come to the point that China must cut off the oil from North Korea. \n>That would be a pivotal step in the world’s effort to stop this international pariah. \n>As I mentioned, many countries have made some big economic and political sacrifices by cutting ties with North Korea. \n>They did that to serve the peace and security of all of us. \n>We now turn to President Xi to also take that stand.\n>We believe he has an opportunity to do the right thing for the benefit of all countries. \n>China must show leadership and follow through. \n>China can do this on its own, \n>Or we can take the oil situation into our own hands.\n>The dictator of North Korea made a choice yesterday that brings the world closer to war, not farther from it. \n>We have never sought war with North Korea, and still today we do not seek it. \n>If war does come, it will be because of continued acts of aggression like we witnessed yesterday. \n>And if war comes, make no mistake, the North Korean regime will be utterly destroyed.\n",

Also - pics from Google Earth show he faked a tennis court with a high dirt fence to cover hidden entry to underground pedo tunnels/city - now the 'tennis court' is removed, you can see the structure&hellip;\n",

The $6 billion Saudi officials are demanding from Prince al-Waleed, a large stakeholder in Western businesses like Twitter, is among the highest figures they have sought from those arrested, some of the people familiar with the matter said.\"\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/articles/the-price-of-freedom-for-saudi-arabias-richest-man-6-billion-1513981887\n",

    "text": "Theory of bitcoin\n\nhttps://www.therussophile.org/evidence-points-to-bitcoin-being-nsa-engineered-psyop-to-roll-out.html/\n\n1) Roll out the NSA-created Bitcoin to get the public excited about a digital currency.\n2) Quietly prepare a globalist-controlled cryptocurrency to take its place. (JP Morgan, anyone?)\n3) Initiate a massive, global-scale false flag operation that crashes the global debt markets and sends fiat currencies down in flames. (Hoax alien invasion, hoax North Korean EMP attack, mass distributed power grid terrorism network, etc.)\n4) Blame whatever convenient enemy is politically acceptable (North Korea, “the Russians,” Little Green Men or whatever it takes…).\n5) Allow the fiat currency debt pyramid to collapse and smolder until the sheeple get desperate (i.e. Venezuela-style desperation with people eating out of dumpsters).\n6) With great fanfare, announce a government-backed cryptocurrency replacement for all fiat currencies, and position world governments as the SAVIOR of humanity. Allow the desperate public to trade in their fiat currencies for official crypto currencies.\n7) Outlaw cash and criminalize gold and silver ownership by private citizens. All in the name of “security,” of course.\n8) Criminalize all non-official cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, crashing their value virtually overnight and funneling everyone into the one world government crypto, where the NSA controls the blockchain. This can easily be achieved by blaming the false flag event (see above) on some nation or group that is said to have been “funded by Bitcoin, the cryptocurrency used by terrorists.”\n9) Require embedded RFID or biometric identifiers for all transactions in order to “authenticate” the one-world digital crypto currency activities. Mark of the Beast becomes reality. No one is allowed to eat, travel or earn a wage without being marked.\n10) Once absolute control over the new one-world digital currency is achieved, weaponize the government-tracked blockchain to track all transactions, investments and commercial activities. Confiscate a portion of all crypto under the guise of “automated taxation.” In an emergency, the government can even announce negative interest rates where your holdings automatically decrease each day.\nWith all this accomplished, globalists can now roll out absolute totalitarian control over every aspect of private lives by enforcing financial “blackouts” for those individuals who criticize the government. They can put in place automatic deductions for traffic violations, vehicle license plate taxes, internet taxes and a thousand other oppressive taxes invented by the bureaucracy. With automatic deductions run by the government, citizens have no means to halt the endless confiscation of their “money” by totalitarian bureaucrats and their deep state lackeys.\n",

The $6 billion Saudi officials are demanding from Prince al-Waleed, a large stakeholder in Western businesses like Twitter, is among the highest figures they have sought from those arrested, some of the people familiar with the matter said.\"\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/articles/the-price-of-freedom-for-saudi-arabias-richest-man-6-billion-1513981887\n",

Dana Rohrabacher, California Republican, will appear before the House panel later this month to answer questions concerning his August 2017 meeting in London with Mr. Assange, the lawmaker told The Los Angeles Times.\n\n“As you can see, I am not worried,” Mr. Rohrabacher said Monday. “I have no worries at all. Once the public understands that the regular media has given them a false impression of my meetings with Russians, it’ll be fine,” he told The Times.\n\nWikiLeaks published emails throughout the 2016 election cycle belonging to both the Democratic National Committee and John Podesta, the chairman of the party’s nominee for president, Hillary Clinton.\n\nThe U.S. intelligence community has determined that the emails were initially obtained by hackers working on behalf of the Russian government, but Mr. Rohrabacher – the chair of the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Europe, Eurasia and Emerging Threats – left an Aug. 16 meeting with Mr. Assange convinced otherwise.\n\nhttps://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/dec/5/dana-rohrabacher-to-testify-before-investigators-a/\n",

(AP) &ndash; The kids did their part, but Mother Nature had the final say in scuttling the annual Christmas Day trip across the Delaware River by George Washington and his troops.\n\nOrganizers said high winds Monday prompted cancellation of the annual reenactment, which draws thousands of people to the banks of the river in Washington Crossing, Pennsylvania, and Titusville, New Jersey. The National Weather Service says winds have been gusting 45 or 50 mph or even a bit more in southeastern Pennsylvania and New Jersey.\n\nLow water levels in the river originally threatened to cancel the trip by re-enactors in their wooden Durham boats. But Philadelphia Waterborne, a nonprofit that teaches boat-building skills to middle- and high-school students, provided six handmade, 12-foot rowboats that could have made it across.\n",

The blast occurred near Marada, on the pipeline belonging to the Waha oil company, the source told Reuters.\nUnverified photos of what is said to be a plume of black smoke coming from the site of the pipeline explosion are being shared on social media.\nThe news of the Libyan blast saw oil prices spike to above $65 a barrel on Tuesday, trading close to its highest mark since mid-2015. Another factor contributing to the increase in price are the voluntary supply cuts by OPEC. Brent crude, the international benchmark for oil prices, went up 10 cents to $65.35 a barrel, while US crude added 12 cents at $58.59, Reuters reported.\nThe port of Es Sider changed hands on several occasions during the Libyan civil war, which started in 2011. It was severely damaged by the fighting, and remained closed between 2014 and 2016. This March Es Sider, which was shipping around 447,000 barrels per day when the conflict started, was recaptured by forces loyal to Libya’s eastern-based military commander, Khalifa Haftar, and resumed operations.\n",

This change results from such a review.\"\nOfficials cited several reasons for the decision: the volume of the tweet database is much bigger than it was a few years ago and the library lacks the capacity to deal with images and items other than text.\nThe library in 2010 began its tweet archive after receiving a \"gift\" from Twitter of the full database of public tweets dating from the first tweet in 2006, but has not determined when or how to make this public.\nThe archive \"will remain embargoed until access issues can be resolved in a cost-effective and sustainable manner,\" Osterberg said.\nA statement said the library from 2018 \"will continue to acquire tweets but will do so on a very selective basis\" adding that the collection will likely be \"thematic and event- based, including events such as elections, or themes of ongoing national interest, e.g. public policy.\"\nStill, it added that the 12-year archive of tweets already collected \"may prove to be one of this generation's most significant legacies to future generations.\"\nThe move prompted considerable reaction—including on Twitter.\n\"Not good,\" tweeted CNBC news associate Mariam Amin.\n\"I want every tweet to be archived. In 40 years, I want to take my granddaughter to the Library of Congress and show her the madness I dealt with as a journalist&hellip;make every tweet count.\"\nHow to choose?\nOthers questioned how the institution would determine which tweets are historically important.\nThe library \"now needs to decide which of all our tweets are a valuable record of events in public life,\" tweeted the consumer activist group Public Knowledge.\nBut the news site PoliticusUSA appeared to welcome the decision, tweeting that the library \"would be no longer be wasting its resources by trying to archive every single public post published on Twitter.\"\nSome Twitter users lamented the quality of the messaging platform and the impact of prolific tweeter Donald Trump.\n\"Trump has managed to lower the value of Twitter,\" one user wrote.\n\"Now the Library of Congress won't archive every Tweet. #sorrytwitter. That must be because most of his tweets are embarrassing to the rest of the nation.\"\nJennifer Grygiel, communications professor at Syracuse University, said the move was disappointing from an institution \"which is perceived to be the greatest library and archive in our country.\"\n\"This could lead to increased rhetoric about how there is too much user-generated social media content for companies to effectively manage or moderate,\" Grygiel told AFP\n\"Social media is not 'too big to moderate;' it takes time, money, and resources to effectively manage social media content.\"\"\n\nhttps://phys.org/ news/2017-12-library-congress-backtracks-twitter-archive.html#nRlv\n",

The global competition asks entrants to develop systems that can help humans navigate, map and search in underground locations that are normally too perilous to visit.\n\"One of the main limitations facing war fighters and emergency responders in subterranean environments is a lack of situational awareness; we often don't know what lies beneath us,\" Timothy Chung, program manager in DARPA's Tactical Technology Office (TTO), said in a statement. \"The DARPA Subterranean Challenge aims to provide previously unimaginable situational awareness capabilities for operations underground.\" \nGroups all around the world will compete to solve problems that help people navigate in unknown, treacherous subterranean conditions, where time is of the essence, according to the statement.\nTeams can compete in one of two tracks: a Systems track, to develop hardware-based solutions for a physical course, or a Virtual track, to develop software to test on a simulated course, DARPA said.\nThe final competition, which will take place in 2021, will include three challenges that involve navigating in one of three environments: a network of human-made tunnels, a subterranean municipal-transit system and a network of underground natural caves. The final event will challenge teams to navigate networks that include elements of all three environments. The grand-prize winners will take home $2 million. The deadline to apply is Jan. 18, 2018.\nThe development of robotics, biological and autonomous systems has reached a crucial juncture, with such systems now conceivable, said TTO Director Fred Kennedy.\n\"Instead of avoiding caves and tunnels, we can use surrogates to map and assess their suitability for use. Through the DARPA Subterranean Challenge, we are inviting the scientific and engineering communities — as well as the public — to use their creativity and resourcefulness to come up with new technologies and concepts to make the inaccessible accessible,\" Kennedy said in the statement.\"\n\nhttps://www.livescience.com/ 61278-darpa-wants-humans-to-navigate-underground.html\n",

    "text": "Jeffrey #Pedogate Epstein - now there are 36 lawsuits filed against him.\n\n\"Judge delays, tries to rein in X-rated civil trial of Jeffrey Epstein\"\n\nWEST PALM BEACH —\n\"What promised to be a salacious trial probing billionaire Jeffrey Epstein’s sexual relationships with underage girls won’t get underway next week as planned.\n\nCiting the many unanswered legal questions that still swirl around the 8-year-old civil lawsuit pitting attorney Bradley Edwards against the 64-year-old Palm Beach convicted sex offender, Palm Beach County Circuit Judge Donald Hafele agreed to delay the trial until March.\n\nUnder the circumstances of this unusual and relatively complex case, the court finds that there are simply too many significant, lengthy motions that are pending and need to be heard prior to December 5, 2017, the date that the trial was originally scheduled to commence,” Hafele wrote in an order, granting a motion from Epstein’s new defense team to delay the trial until next year.\"\n\n\n\nHis pedo palace in USVI&hellip;the \"temple\" dome is off, but the temple building is intact. Also - pics from Google Earth show he faked a tennis court with a high dirt fence to cover hidden entry to underground pedo tunnels/city - now the 'tennis court' is removed, you can see the structure&hellip;\n",

Through sanctions we have cut off 90 percent of North Korean trade and 30 percent of its oil. \n>But the crude oil remains. \n>The major supplier of that oil is China. \n>In 2003, China actually stopped the oil to North Korea. \n>Soon after, North Korea came to the table. \n>We need China to do more.\n>President Trump called Chinese President Xi this morning \n>And told him that we have come to the point that China must cut off the oil from North Korea. \n>That would be a pivotal step in the world’s effort to stop this international pariah. \n>As I mentioned, many countries have made some big economic and political sacrifices by cutting ties with North Korea. \n>They did that to serve the peace and security of all of us. \n>We now turn to President Xi to also take that stand.\n>We believe he has an opportunity to do the right thing for the benefit of all countries. \n>China must show leadership and follow through. \n>China can do this on its own, \n>Or we can take the oil situation into our own hands.\n>The dictator of North Korea made a choice yesterday that brings the world closer to war, not farther from it. \n>We have never sought war with North Korea, and still today we do not seek it. \n>If war does come, it will be because of continued acts of aggression like we witnessed yesterday. \n>And if war comes, make no mistake, the North Korean regime will be utterly destroyed.\n",

Also - pics from Google Earth show he faked a tennis court with a high dirt fence to cover hidden entry to underground pedo tunnels/city - now the 'tennis court' is removed, you can see the structure&hellip;\n",

The $6 billion Saudi officials are demanding from Prince al-Waleed, a large stakeholder in Western businesses like Twitter, is among the highest figures they have sought from those arrested, some of the people familiar with the matter said.\"\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/articles/the-price-of-freedom-for-saudi-arabias-richest-man-6-billion-1513981887\n",

    "text": "Theory of bitcoin\n\nhttps://www.therussophile.org/evidence-points-to-bitcoin-being-nsa-engineered-psyop-to-roll-out.html/\n\n1) Roll out the NSA-created Bitcoin to get the public excited about a digital currency.\n2) Quietly prepare a globalist-controlled cryptocurrency to take its place. (JP Morgan, anyone?)\n3) Initiate a massive, global-scale false flag operation that crashes the global debt markets and sends fiat currencies down in flames. (Hoax alien invasion, hoax North Korean EMP attack, mass distributed power grid terrorism network, etc.)\n4) Blame whatever convenient enemy is politically acceptable (North Korea, “the Russians,” Little Green Men or whatever it takes…).\n5) Allow the fiat currency debt pyramid to collapse and smolder until the sheeple get desperate (i.e. Venezuela-style desperation with people eating out of dumpsters).\n6) With great fanfare, announce a government-backed cryptocurrency replacement for all fiat currencies, and position world governments as the SAVIOR of humanity. Allow the desperate public to trade in their fiat currencies for official crypto currencies.\n7) Outlaw cash and criminalize gold and silver ownership by private citizens. All in the name of “security,” of course.\n8) Criminalize all non-official cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, crashing their value virtually overnight and funneling everyone into the one world government crypto, where the NSA controls the blockchain. This can easily be achieved by blaming the false flag event (see above) on some nation or group that is said to have been “funded by Bitcoin, the cryptocurrency used by terrorists.”\n9) Require embedded RFID or biometric identifiers for all transactions in order to “authenticate” the one-world digital crypto currency activities. Mark of the Beast becomes reality. No one is allowed to eat, travel or earn a wage without being marked.\n10) Once absolute control over the new one-world digital currency is achieved, weaponize the government-tracked blockchain to track all transactions, investments and commercial activities. Confiscate a portion of all crypto under the guise of “automated taxation.” In an emergency, the government can even announce negative interest rates where your holdings automatically decrease each day.\nWith all this accomplished, globalists can now roll out absolute totalitarian control over every aspect of private lives by enforcing financial “blackouts” for those individuals who criticize the government. They can put in place automatic deductions for traffic violations, vehicle license plate taxes, internet taxes and a thousand other oppressive taxes invented by the bureaucracy. With automatic deductions run by the government, citizens have no means to halt the endless confiscation of their “money” by totalitarian bureaucrats and their deep state lackeys.\n",

The $6 billion Saudi officials are demanding from Prince al-Waleed, a large stakeholder in Western businesses like Twitter, is among the highest figures they have sought from those arrested, some of the people familiar with the matter said.\"\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/articles/the-price-of-freedom-for-saudi-arabias-richest-man-6-billion-1513981887\n",

Dana Rohrabacher, California Republican, will appear before the House panel later this month to answer questions concerning his August 2017 meeting in London with Mr. Assange, the lawmaker told The Los Angeles Times.\n\n“As you can see, I am not worried,” Mr. Rohrabacher said Monday. “I have no worries at all. Once the public understands that the regular media has given them a false impression of my meetings with Russians, it’ll be fine,” he told The Times.\n\nWikiLeaks published emails throughout the 2016 election cycle belonging to both the Democratic National Committee and John Podesta, the chairman of the party’s nominee for president, Hillary Clinton.\n\nThe U.S. intelligence community has determined that the emails were initially obtained by hackers working on behalf of the Russian government, but Mr. Rohrabacher – the chair of the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Europe, Eurasia and Emerging Threats – left an Aug. 16 meeting with Mr. Assange convinced otherwise.\n\nhttps://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/dec/5/dana-rohrabacher-to-testify-before-investigators-a/\n",

(AP) &ndash; The kids did their part, but Mother Nature had the final say in scuttling the annual Christmas Day trip across the Delaware River by George Washington and his troops.\n\nOrganizers said high winds Monday prompted cancellation of the annual reenactment, which draws thousands of people to the banks of the river in Washington Crossing, Pennsylvania, and Titusville, New Jersey. The National Weather Service says winds have been gusting 45 or 50 mph or even a bit more in southeastern Pennsylvania and New Jersey.\n\nLow water levels in the river originally threatened to cancel the trip by re-enactors in their wooden Durham boats. But Philadelphia Waterborne, a nonprofit that teaches boat-building skills to middle- and high-school students, provided six handmade, 12-foot rowboats that could have made it across.\n",

The blast occurred near Marada, on the pipeline belonging to the Waha oil company, the source told Reuters.\nUnverified photos of what is said to be a plume of black smoke coming from the site of the pipeline explosion are being shared on social media.\nThe news of the Libyan blast saw oil prices spike to above $65 a barrel on Tuesday, trading close to its highest mark since mid-2015. Another factor contributing to the increase in price are the voluntary supply cuts by OPEC. Brent crude, the international benchmark for oil prices, went up 10 cents to $65.35 a barrel, while US crude added 12 cents at $58.59, Reuters reported.\nThe port of Es Sider changed hands on several occasions during the Libyan civil war, which started in 2011. It was severely damaged by the fighting, and remained closed between 2014 and 2016. This March Es Sider, which was shipping around 447,000 barrels per day when the conflict started, was recaptured by forces loyal to Libya’s eastern-based military commander, Khalifa Haftar, and resumed operations.\n",

This change results from such a review.\"\nOfficials cited several reasons for the decision: the volume of the tweet database is much bigger than it was a few years ago and the library lacks the capacity to deal with images and items other than text.\nThe library in 2010 began its tweet archive after receiving a \"gift\" from Twitter of the full database of public tweets dating from the first tweet in 2006, but has not determined when or how to make this public.\nThe archive \"will remain embargoed until access issues can be resolved in a cost-effective and sustainable manner,\" Osterberg said.\nA statement said the library from 2018 \"will continue to acquire tweets but will do so on a very selective basis\" adding that the collection will likely be \"thematic and event- based, including events such as elections, or themes of ongoing national interest, e.g. public policy.\"\nStill, it added that the 12-year archive of tweets already collected \"may prove to be one of this generation's most significant legacies to future generations.\"\nThe move prompted considerable reaction—including on Twitter.\n\"Not good,\" tweeted CNBC news associate Mariam Amin.\n\"I want every tweet to be archived. In 40 years, I want to take my granddaughter to the Library of Congress and show her the madness I dealt with as a journalist&hellip;make every tweet count.\"\nHow to choose?\nOthers questioned how the institution would determine which tweets are historically important.\nThe library \"now needs to decide which of all our tweets are a valuable record of events in public life,\" tweeted the consumer activist group Public Knowledge.\nBut the news site PoliticusUSA appeared to welcome the decision, tweeting that the library \"would be no longer be wasting its resources by trying to archive every single public post published on Twitter.\"\nSome Twitter users lamented the quality of the messaging platform and the impact of prolific tweeter Donald Trump.\n\"Trump has managed to lower the value of Twitter,\" one user wrote.\n\"Now the Library of Congress won't archive every Tweet. #sorrytwitter. That must be because most of his tweets are embarrassing to the rest of the nation.\"\nJennifer Grygiel, communications professor at Syracuse University, said the move was disappointing from an institution \"which is perceived to be the greatest library and archive in our country.\"\n\"This could lead to increased rhetoric about how there is too much user-generated social media content for companies to effectively manage or moderate,\" Grygiel told AFP\n\"Social media is not 'too big to moderate;' it takes time, money, and resources to effectively manage social media content.\"\"\n\nhttps://phys.org/ news/2017-12-library-congress-backtracks-twitter-archive.html#nRlv\n",

The global competition asks entrants to develop systems that can help humans navigate, map and search in underground locations that are normally too perilous to visit.\n\"One of the main limitations facing war fighters and emergency responders in subterranean environments is a lack of situational awareness; we often don't know what lies beneath us,\" Timothy Chung, program manager in DARPA's Tactical Technology Office (TTO), said in a statement. \"The DARPA Subterranean Challenge aims to provide previously unimaginable situational awareness capabilities for operations underground.\" \nGroups all around the world will compete to solve problems that help people navigate in unknown, treacherous subterranean conditions, where time is of the essence, according to the statement.\nTeams can compete in one of two tracks: a Systems track, to develop hardware-based solutions for a physical course, or a Virtual track, to develop software to test on a simulated course, DARPA said.\nThe final competition, which will take place in 2021, will include three challenges that involve navigating in one of three environments: a network of human-made tunnels, a subterranean municipal-transit system and a network of underground natural caves. The final event will challenge teams to navigate networks that include elements of all three environments. The grand-prize winners will take home $2 million. The deadline to apply is Jan. 18, 2018.\nThe development of robotics, biological and autonomous systems has reached a crucial juncture, with such systems now conceivable, said TTO Director Fred Kennedy.\n\"Instead of avoiding caves and tunnels, we can use surrogates to map and assess their suitability for use. Through the DARPA Subterranean Challenge, we are inviting the scientific and engineering communities — as well as the public — to use their creativity and resourcefulness to come up with new technologies and concepts to make the inaccessible accessible,\" Kennedy said in the statement.\"\n\nhttps://www.livescience.com/ 61278-darpa-wants-humans-to-navigate-underground.html\n",

    "text": "Jeffrey #Pedogate Epstein - now there are 36 lawsuits filed against him.\n\n\"Judge delays, tries to rein in X-rated civil trial of Jeffrey Epstein\"\n\nWEST PALM BEACH —\n\"What promised to be a salacious trial probing billionaire Jeffrey Epstein’s sexual relationships with underage girls won’t get underway next week as planned.\n\nCiting the many unanswered legal questions that still swirl around the 8-year-old civil lawsuit pitting attorney Bradley Edwards against the 64-year-old Palm Beach convicted sex offender, Palm Beach County Circuit Judge Donald Hafele agreed to delay the trial until March.\n\nUnder the circumstances of this unusual and relatively complex case, the court finds that there are simply too many significant, lengthy motions that are pending and need to be heard prior to December 5, 2017, the date that the trial was originally scheduled to commence,” Hafele wrote in an order, granting a motion from Epstein’s new defense team to delay the trial until next year.\"\n\n\n\nHis pedo palace in USVI&hellip;the \"temple\" dome is off, but the temple building is intact. Also - pics from Google Earth show he faked a tennis court with a high dirt fence to cover hidden entry to underground pedo tunnels/city - now the 'tennis court' is removed, you can see the structure&hellip;\n",

Through sanctions we have cut off 90 percent of North Korean trade and 30 percent of its oil. \n>But the crude oil remains. \n>The major supplier of that oil is China. \n>In 2003, China actually stopped the oil to North Korea. \n>Soon after, North Korea came to the table. \n>We need China to do more.\n>President Trump called Chinese President Xi this morning \n>And told him that we have come to the point that China must cut off the oil from North Korea. \n>That would be a pivotal step in the world’s effort to stop this international pariah. \n>As I mentioned, many countries have made some big economic and political sacrifices by cutting ties with North Korea. \n>They did that to serve the peace and security of all of us. \n>We now turn to President Xi to also take that stand.\n>We believe he has an opportunity to do the right thing for the benefit of all countries. \n>China must show leadership and follow through. \n>China can do this on its own, \n>Or we can take the oil situation into our own hands.\n>The dictator of North Korea made a choice yesterday that brings the world closer to war, not farther from it. \n>We have never sought war with North Korea, and still today we do not seek it. \n>If war does come, it will be because of continued acts of aggression like we witnessed yesterday. \n>And if war comes, make no mistake, the North Korean regime will be utterly destroyed.\n",

Also - pics from Google Earth show he faked a tennis court with a high dirt fence to cover hidden entry to underground pedo tunnels/city - now the 'tennis court' is removed, you can see the structure&hellip;\n",

The $6 billion Saudi officials are demanding from Prince al-Waleed, a large stakeholder in Western businesses like Twitter, is among the highest figures they have sought from those arrested, some of the people familiar with the matter said.\"\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/articles/the-price-of-freedom-for-saudi-arabias-richest-man-6-billion-1513981887\n",

    "text": "Theory of bitcoin\n\nhttps://www.therussophile.org/evidence-points-to-bitcoin-being-nsa-engineered-psyop-to-roll-out.html/\n\n1) Roll out the NSA-created Bitcoin to get the public excited about a digital currency.\n2) Quietly prepare a globalist-controlled cryptocurrency to take its place. (JP Morgan, anyone?)\n3) Initiate a massive, global-scale false flag operation that crashes the global debt markets and sends fiat currencies down in flames. (Hoax alien invasion, hoax North Korean EMP attack, mass distributed power grid terrorism network, etc.)\n4) Blame whatever convenient enemy is politically acceptable (North Korea, “the Russians,” Little Green Men or whatever it takes…).\n5) Allow the fiat currency debt pyramid to collapse and smolder until the sheeple get desperate (i.e. Venezuela-style desperation with people eating out of dumpsters).\n6) With great fanfare, announce a government-backed cryptocurrency replacement for all fiat currencies, and position world governments as the SAVIOR of humanity. Allow the desperate public to trade in their fiat currencies for official crypto currencies.\n7) Outlaw cash and criminalize gold and silver ownership by private citizens. All in the name of “security,” of course.\n8) Criminalize all non-official cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, crashing their value virtually overnight and funneling everyone into the one world government crypto, where the NSA controls the blockchain. This can easily be achieved by blaming the false flag event (see above) on some nation or group that is said to have been “funded by Bitcoin, the cryptocurrency used by terrorists.”\n9) Require embedded RFID or biometric identifiers for all transactions in order to “authenticate” the one-world digital crypto currency activities. Mark of the Beast becomes reality. No one is allowed to eat, travel or earn a wage without being marked.\n10) Once absolute control over the new one-world digital currency is achieved, weaponize the government-tracked blockchain to track all transactions, investments and commercial activities. Confiscate a portion of all crypto under the guise of “automated taxation.” In an emergency, the government can even announce negative interest rates where your holdings automatically decrease each day.\nWith all this accomplished, globalists can now roll out absolute totalitarian control over every aspect of private lives by enforcing financial “blackouts” for those individuals who criticize the government. They can put in place automatic deductions for traffic violations, vehicle license plate taxes, internet taxes and a thousand other oppressive taxes invented by the bureaucracy. With automatic deductions run by the government, citizens have no means to halt the endless confiscation of their “money” by totalitarian bureaucrats and their deep state lackeys.\n",

The $6 billion Saudi officials are demanding from Prince al-Waleed, a large stakeholder in Western businesses like Twitter, is among the highest figures they have sought from those arrested, some of the people familiar with the matter said.\"\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/articles/the-price-of-freedom-for-saudi-arabias-richest-man-6-billion-1513981887\n",

Dana Rohrabacher, California Republican, will appear before the House panel later this month to answer questions concerning his August 2017 meeting in London with Mr. Assange, the lawmaker told The Los Angeles Times.\n\n“As you can see, I am not worried,” Mr. Rohrabacher said Monday. “I have no worries at all. Once the public understands that the regular media has given them a false impression of my meetings with Russians, it’ll be fine,” he told The Times.\n\nWikiLeaks published emails throughout the 2016 election cycle belonging to both the Democratic National Committee and John Podesta, the chairman of the party’s nominee for president, Hillary Clinton.\n\nThe U.S. intelligence community has determined that the emails were initially obtained by hackers working on behalf of the Russian government, but Mr. Rohrabacher – the chair of the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Europe, Eurasia and Emerging Threats – left an Aug. 16 meeting with Mr. Assange convinced otherwise.\n\nhttps://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/dec/5/dana-rohrabacher-to-testify-before-investigators-a/\n",

(AP) &ndash; The kids did their part, but Mother Nature had the final say in scuttling the annual Christmas Day trip across the Delaware River by George Washington and his troops.\n\nOrganizers said high winds Monday prompted cancellation of the annual reenactment, which draws thousands of people to the banks of the river in Washington Crossing, Pennsylvania, and Titusville, New Jersey. The National Weather Service says winds have been gusting 45 or 50 mph or even a bit more in southeastern Pennsylvania and New Jersey.\n\nLow water levels in the river originally threatened to cancel the trip by re-enactors in their wooden Durham boats. But Philadelphia Waterborne, a nonprofit that teaches boat-building skills to middle- and high-school students, provided six handmade, 12-foot rowboats that could have made it across.\n",

The blast occurred near Marada, on the pipeline belonging to the Waha oil company, the source told Reuters.\nUnverified photos of what is said to be a plume of black smoke coming from the site of the pipeline explosion are being shared on social media.\nThe news of the Libyan blast saw oil prices spike to above $65 a barrel on Tuesday, trading close to its highest mark since mid-2015. Another factor contributing to the increase in price are the voluntary supply cuts by OPEC. Brent crude, the international benchmark for oil prices, went up 10 cents to $65.35 a barrel, while US crude added 12 cents at $58.59, Reuters reported.\nThe port of Es Sider changed hands on several occasions during the Libyan civil war, which started in 2011. It was severely damaged by the fighting, and remained closed between 2014 and 2016. This March Es Sider, which was shipping around 447,000 barrels per day when the conflict started, was recaptured by forces loyal to Libya’s eastern-based military commander, Khalifa Haftar, and resumed operations.\n",

This change results from such a review.\"\nOfficials cited several reasons for the decision: the volume of the tweet database is much bigger than it was a few years ago and the library lacks the capacity to deal with images and items other than text.\nThe library in 2010 began its tweet archive after receiving a \"gift\" from Twitter of the full database of public tweets dating from the first tweet in 2006, but has not determined when or how to make this public.\nThe archive \"will remain embargoed until access issues can be resolved in a cost-effective and sustainable manner,\" Osterberg said.\nA statement said the library from 2018 \"will continue to acquire tweets but will do so on a very selective basis\" adding that the collection will likely be \"thematic and event- based, including events such as elections, or themes of ongoing national interest, e.g. public policy.\"\nStill, it added that the 12-year archive of tweets already collected \"may prove to be one of this generation's most significant legacies to future generations.\"\nThe move prompted considerable reaction—including on Twitter.\n\"Not good,\" tweeted CNBC news associate Mariam Amin.\n\"I want every tweet to be archived. In 40 years, I want to take my granddaughter to the Library of Congress and show her the madness I dealt with as a journalist&hellip;make every tweet count.\"\nHow to choose?\nOthers questioned how the institution would determine which tweets are historically important.\nThe library \"now needs to decide which of all our tweets are a valuable record of events in public life,\" tweeted the consumer activist group Public Knowledge.\nBut the news site PoliticusUSA appeared to welcome the decision, tweeting that the library \"would be no longer be wasting its resources by trying to archive every single public post published on Twitter.\"\nSome Twitter users lamented the quality of the messaging platform and the impact of prolific tweeter Donald Trump.\n\"Trump has managed to lower the value of Twitter,\" one user wrote.\n\"Now the Library of Congress won't archive every Tweet. #sorrytwitter. That must be because most of his tweets are embarrassing to the rest of the nation.\"\nJennifer Grygiel, communications professor at Syracuse University, said the move was disappointing from an institution \"which is perceived to be the greatest library and archive in our country.\"\n\"This could lead to increased rhetoric about how there is too much user-generated social media content for companies to effectively manage or moderate,\" Grygiel told AFP\n\"Social media is not 'too big to moderate;' it takes time, money, and resources to effectively manage social media content.\"\"\n\nhttps://phys.org/ news/2017-12-library-congress-backtracks-twitter-archive.html#nRlv\n",

The global competition asks entrants to develop systems that can help humans navigate, map and search in underground locations that are normally too perilous to visit.\n\"One of the main limitations facing war fighters and emergency responders in subterranean environments is a lack of situational awareness; we often don't know what lies beneath us,\" Timothy Chung, program manager in DARPA's Tactical Technology Office (TTO), said in a statement. \"The DARPA Subterranean Challenge aims to provide previously unimaginable situational awareness capabilities for operations underground.\" \nGroups all around the world will compete to solve problems that help people navigate in unknown, treacherous subterranean conditions, where time is of the essence, according to the statement.\nTeams can compete in one of two tracks: a Systems track, to develop hardware-based solutions for a physical course, or a Virtual track, to develop software to test on a simulated course, DARPA said.\nThe final competition, which will take place in 2021, will include three challenges that involve navigating in one of three environments: a network of human-made tunnels, a subterranean municipal-transit system and a network of underground natural caves. The final event will challenge teams to navigate networks that include elements of all three environments. The grand-prize winners will take home $2 million. The deadline to apply is Jan. 18, 2018.\nThe development of robotics, biological and autonomous systems has reached a crucial juncture, with such systems now conceivable, said TTO Director Fred Kennedy.\n\"Instead of avoiding caves and tunnels, we can use surrogates to map and assess their suitability for use. Through the DARPA Subterranean Challenge, we are inviting the scientific and engineering communities — as well as the public — to use their creativity and resourcefulness to come up with new technologies and concepts to make the inaccessible accessible,\" Kennedy said in the statement.\"\n\nhttps://www.livescience.com/ 61278-darpa-wants-humans-to-navigate-underground.html\n",

    "text": "Jeffrey #Pedogate Epstein - now there are 36 lawsuits filed against him.\n\n\"Judge delays, tries to rein in X-rated civil trial of Jeffrey Epstein\"\n\nWEST PALM BEACH —\n\"What promised to be a salacious trial probing billionaire Jeffrey Epstein’s sexual relationships with underage girls won’t get underway next week as planned.\n\nCiting the many unanswered legal questions that still swirl around the 8-year-old civil lawsuit pitting attorney Bradley Edwards against the 64-year-old Palm Beach convicted sex offender, Palm Beach County Circuit Judge Donald Hafele agreed to delay the trial until March.\n\nUnder the circumstances of this unusual and relatively complex case, the court finds that there are simply too many significant, lengthy motions that are pending and need to be heard prior to December 5, 2017, the date that the trial was originally scheduled to commence,” Hafele wrote in an order, granting a motion from Epstein’s new defense team to delay the trial until next year.\"\n\n\n\nHis pedo palace in USVI&hellip;the \"temple\" dome is off, but the temple building is intact. Also - pics from Google Earth show he faked a tennis court with a high dirt fence to cover hidden entry to underground pedo tunnels/city - now the 'tennis court' is removed, you can see the structure&hellip;\n",

Through sanctions we have cut off 90 percent of North Korean trade and 30 percent of its oil. \n>But the crude oil remains. \n>The major supplier of that oil is China. \n>In 2003, China actually stopped the oil to North Korea. \n>Soon after, North Korea came to the table. \n>We need China to do more.\n>President Trump called Chinese President Xi this morning \n>And told him that we have come to the point that China must cut off the oil from North Korea. \n>That would be a pivotal step in the world’s effort to stop this international pariah. \n>As I mentioned, many countries have made some big economic and political sacrifices by cutting ties with North Korea. \n>They did that to serve the peace and security of all of us. \n>We now turn to President Xi to also take that stand.\n>We believe he has an opportunity to do the right thing for the benefit of all countries. \n>China must show leadership and follow through. \n>China can do this on its own, \n>Or we can take the oil situation into our own hands.\n>The dictator of North Korea made a choice yesterday that brings the world closer to war, not farther from it. \n>We have never sought war with North Korea, and still today we do not seek it. \n>If war does come, it will be because of continued acts of aggression like we witnessed yesterday. \n>And if war comes, make no mistake, the North Korean regime will be utterly destroyed.\n",

Also - pics from Google Earth show he faked a tennis court with a high dirt fence to cover hidden entry to underground pedo tunnels/city - now the 'tennis court' is removed, you can see the structure&hellip;\n",

The $6 billion Saudi officials are demanding from Prince al-Waleed, a large stakeholder in Western businesses like Twitter, is among the highest figures they have sought from those arrested, some of the people familiar with the matter said.\"\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/articles/the-price-of-freedom-for-saudi-arabias-richest-man-6-billion-1513981887\n",

    "text": "Theory of bitcoin\n\nhttps://www.therussophile.org/evidence-points-to-bitcoin-being-nsa-engineered-psyop-to-roll-out.html/\n\n1) Roll out the NSA-created Bitcoin to get the public excited about a digital currency.\n2) Quietly prepare a globalist-controlled cryptocurrency to take its place. (JP Morgan, anyone?)\n3) Initiate a massive, global-scale false flag operation that crashes the global debt markets and sends fiat currencies down in flames. (Hoax alien invasion, hoax North Korean EMP attack, mass distributed power grid terrorism network, etc.)\n4) Blame whatever convenient enemy is politically acceptable (North Korea, “the Russians,” Little Green Men or whatever it takes…).\n5) Allow the fiat currency debt pyramid to collapse and smolder until the sheeple get desperate (i.e. Venezuela-style desperation with people eating out of dumpsters).\n6) With great fanfare, announce a government-backed cryptocurrency replacement for all fiat currencies, and position world governments as the SAVIOR of humanity. Allow the desperate public to trade in their fiat currencies for official crypto currencies.\n7) Outlaw cash and criminalize gold and silver ownership by private citizens. All in the name of “security,” of course.\n8) Criminalize all non-official cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, crashing their value virtually overnight and funneling everyone into the one world government crypto, where the NSA controls the blockchain. This can easily be achieved by blaming the false flag event (see above) on some nation or group that is said to have been “funded by Bitcoin, the cryptocurrency used by terrorists.”\n9) Require embedded RFID or biometric identifiers for all transactions in order to “authenticate” the one-world digital crypto currency activities. Mark of the Beast becomes reality. No one is allowed to eat, travel or earn a wage without being marked.\n10) Once absolute control over the new one-world digital currency is achieved, weaponize the government-tracked blockchain to track all transactions, investments and commercial activities. Confiscate a portion of all crypto under the guise of “automated taxation.” In an emergency, the government can even announce negative interest rates where your holdings automatically decrease each day.\nWith all this accomplished, globalists can now roll out absolute totalitarian control over every aspect of private lives by enforcing financial “blackouts” for those individuals who criticize the government. They can put in place automatic deductions for traffic violations, vehicle license plate taxes, internet taxes and a thousand other oppressive taxes invented by the bureaucracy. With automatic deductions run by the government, citizens have no means to halt the endless confiscation of their “money” by totalitarian bureaucrats and their deep state lackeys.\n",

The $6 billion Saudi officials are demanding from Prince al-Waleed, a large stakeholder in Western businesses like Twitter, is among the highest figures they have sought from those arrested, some of the people familiar with the matter said.\"\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/articles/the-price-of-freedom-for-saudi-arabias-richest-man-6-billion-1513981887\n",

Dana Rohrabacher, California Republican, will appear before the House panel later this month to answer questions concerning his August 2017 meeting in London with Mr. Assange, the lawmaker told The Los Angeles Times.\n\n“As you can see, I am not worried,” Mr. Rohrabacher said Monday. “I have no worries at all. Once the public understands that the regular media has given them a false impression of my meetings with Russians, it’ll be fine,” he told The Times.\n\nWikiLeaks published emails throughout the 2016 election cycle belonging to both the Democratic National Committee and John Podesta, the chairman of the party’s nominee for president, Hillary Clinton.\n\nThe U.S. intelligence community has determined that the emails were initially obtained by hackers working on behalf of the Russian government, but Mr. Rohrabacher – the chair of the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Europe, Eurasia and Emerging Threats – left an Aug. 16 meeting with Mr. Assange convinced otherwise.\n\nhttps://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/dec/5/dana-rohrabacher-to-testify-before-investigators-a/\n",

(AP) &ndash; The kids did their part, but Mother Nature had the final say in scuttling the annual Christmas Day trip across the Delaware River by George Washington and his troops.\n\nOrganizers said high winds Monday prompted cancellation of the annual reenactment, which draws thousands of people to the banks of the river in Washington Crossing, Pennsylvania, and Titusville, New Jersey. The National Weather Service says winds have been gusting 45 or 50 mph or even a bit more in southeastern Pennsylvania and New Jersey.\n\nLow water levels in the river originally threatened to cancel the trip by re-enactors in their wooden Durham boats. But Philadelphia Waterborne, a nonprofit that teaches boat-building skills to middle- and high-school students, provided six handmade, 12-foot rowboats that could have made it across.\n",

The blast occurred near Marada, on the pipeline belonging to the Waha oil company, the source told Reuters.\nUnverified photos of what is said to be a plume of black smoke coming from the site of the pipeline explosion are being shared on social media.\nThe news of the Libyan blast saw oil prices spike to above $65 a barrel on Tuesday, trading close to its highest mark since mid-2015. Another factor contributing to the increase in price are the voluntary supply cuts by OPEC. Brent crude, the international benchmark for oil prices, went up 10 cents to $65.35 a barrel, while US crude added 12 cents at $58.59, Reuters reported.\nThe port of Es Sider changed hands on several occasions during the Libyan civil war, which started in 2011. It was severely damaged by the fighting, and remained closed between 2014 and 2016. This March Es Sider, which was shipping around 447,000 barrels per day when the conflict started, was recaptured by forces loyal to Libya’s eastern-based military commander, Khalifa Haftar, and resumed operations.\n",

This change results from such a review.\"\nOfficials cited several reasons for the decision: the volume of the tweet database is much bigger than it was a few years ago and the library lacks the capacity to deal with images and items other than text.\nThe library in 2010 began its tweet archive after receiving a \"gift\" from Twitter of the full database of public tweets dating from the first tweet in 2006, but has not determined when or how to make this public.\nThe archive \"will remain embargoed until access issues can be resolved in a cost-effective and sustainable manner,\" Osterberg said.\nA statement said the library from 2018 \"will continue to acquire tweets but will do so on a very selective basis\" adding that the collection will likely be \"thematic and event- based, including events such as elections, or themes of ongoing national interest, e.g. public policy.\"\nStill, it added that the 12-year archive of tweets already collected \"may prove to be one of this generation's most significant legacies to future generations.\"\nThe move prompted considerable reaction—including on Twitter.\n\"Not good,\" tweeted CNBC news associate Mariam Amin.\n\"I want every tweet to be archived. In 40 years, I want to take my granddaughter to the Library of Congress and show her the madness I dealt with as a journalist&hellip;make every tweet count.\"\nHow to choose?\nOthers questioned how the institution would determine which tweets are historically important.\nThe library \"now needs to decide which of all our tweets are a valuable record of events in public life,\" tweeted the consumer activist group Public Knowledge.\nBut the news site PoliticusUSA appeared to welcome the decision, tweeting that the library \"would be no longer be wasting its resources by trying to archive every single public post published on Twitter.\"\nSome Twitter users lamented the quality of the messaging platform and the impact of prolific tweeter Donald Trump.\n\"Trump has managed to lower the value of Twitter,\" one user wrote.\n\"Now the Library of Congress won't archive every Tweet. #sorrytwitter. That must be because most of his tweets are embarrassing to the rest of the nation.\"\nJennifer Grygiel, communications professor at Syracuse University, said the move was disappointing from an institution \"which is perceived to be the greatest library and archive in our country.\"\n\"This could lead to increased rhetoric about how there is too much user-generated social media content for companies to effectively manage or moderate,\" Grygiel told AFP\n\"Social media is not 'too big to moderate;' it takes time, money, and resources to effectively manage social media content.\"\"\n\nhttps://phys.org/ news/2017-12-library-congress-backtracks-twitter-archive.html#nRlv\n",

The global competition asks entrants to develop systems that can help humans navigate, map and search in underground locations that are normally too perilous to visit.\n\"One of the main limitations facing war fighters and emergency responders in subterranean environments is a lack of situational awareness; we often don't know what lies beneath us,\" Timothy Chung, program manager in DARPA's Tactical Technology Office (TTO), said in a statement. \"The DARPA Subterranean Challenge aims to provide previously unimaginable situational awareness capabilities for operations underground.\" \nGroups all around the world will compete to solve problems that help people navigate in unknown, treacherous subterranean conditions, where time is of the essence, according to the statement.\nTeams can compete in one of two tracks: a Systems track, to develop hardware-based solutions for a physical course, or a Virtual track, to develop software to test on a simulated course, DARPA said.\nThe final competition, which will take place in 2021, will include three challenges that involve navigating in one of three environments: a network of human-made tunnels, a subterranean municipal-transit system and a network of underground natural caves. The final event will challenge teams to navigate networks that include elements of all three environments. The grand-prize winners will take home $2 million. The deadline to apply is Jan. 18, 2018.\nThe development of robotics, biological and autonomous systems has reached a crucial juncture, with such systems now conceivable, said TTO Director Fred Kennedy.\n\"Instead of avoiding caves and tunnels, we can use surrogates to map and assess their suitability for use. Through the DARPA Subterranean Challenge, we are inviting the scientific and engineering communities — as well as the public — to use their creativity and resourcefulness to come up with new technologies and concepts to make the inaccessible accessible,\" Kennedy said in the statement.\"\n\nhttps://www.livescience.com/ 61278-darpa-wants-humans-to-navigate-underground.html\n",

    "text": "Jeffrey #Pedogate Epstein - now there are 36 lawsuits filed against him.\n\n\"Judge delays, tries to rein in X-rated civil trial of Jeffrey Epstein\"\n\nWEST PALM BEACH —\n\"What promised to be a salacious trial probing billionaire Jeffrey Epstein’s sexual relationships with underage girls won’t get underway next week as planned.\n\nCiting the many unanswered legal questions that still swirl around the 8-year-old civil lawsuit pitting attorney Bradley Edwards against the 64-year-old Palm Beach convicted sex offender, Palm Beach County Circuit Judge Donald Hafele agreed to delay the trial until March.\n\nUnder the circumstances of this unusual and relatively complex case, the court finds that there are simply too many significant, lengthy motions that are pending and need to be heard prior to December 5, 2017, the date that the trial was originally scheduled to commence,” Hafele wrote in an order, granting a motion from Epstein’s new defense team to delay the trial until next year.\"\n\n\n\nHis pedo palace in USVI&hellip;the \"temple\" dome is off, but the temple building is intact. Also - pics from Google Earth show he faked a tennis court with a high dirt fence to cover hidden entry to underground pedo tunnels/city - now the 'tennis court' is removed, you can see the structure&hellip;\n",

Through sanctions we have cut off 90 percent of North Korean trade and 30 percent of its oil. \n>But the crude oil remains. \n>The major supplier of that oil is China. \n>In 2003, China actually stopped the oil to North Korea. \n>Soon after, North Korea came to the table. \n>We need China to do more.\n>President Trump called Chinese President Xi this morning \n>And told him that we have come to the point that China must cut off the oil from North Korea. \n>That would be a pivotal step in the world’s effort to stop this international pariah. \n>As I mentioned, many countries have made some big economic and political sacrifices by cutting ties with North Korea. \n>They did that to serve the peace and security of all of us. \n>We now turn to President Xi to also take that stand.\n>We believe he has an opportunity to do the right thing for the benefit of all countries. \n>China must show leadership and follow through. \n>China can do this on its own, \n>Or we can take the oil situation into our own hands.\n>The dictator of North Korea made a choice yesterday that brings the world closer to war, not farther from it. \n>We have never sought war with North Korea, and still today we do not seek it. \n>If war does come, it will be because of continued acts of aggression like we witnessed yesterday. \n>And if war comes, make no mistake, the North Korean regime will be utterly destroyed.\n",

Also - pics from Google Earth show he faked a tennis court with a high dirt fence to cover hidden entry to underground pedo tunnels/city - now the 'tennis court' is removed, you can see the structure&hellip;\n",

The $6 billion Saudi officials are demanding from Prince al-Waleed, a large stakeholder in Western businesses like Twitter, is among the highest figures they have sought from those arrested, some of the people familiar with the matter said.\"\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/articles/the-price-of-freedom-for-saudi-arabias-richest-man-6-billion-1513981887\n",

    "text": "Theory of bitcoin\n\nhttps://www.therussophile.org/evidence-points-to-bitcoin-being-nsa-engineered-psyop-to-roll-out.html/\n\n1) Roll out the NSA-created Bitcoin to get the public excited about a digital currency.\n2) Quietly prepare a globalist-controlled cryptocurrency to take its place. (JP Morgan, anyone?)\n3) Initiate a massive, global-scale false flag operation that crashes the global debt markets and sends fiat currencies down in flames. (Hoax alien invasion, hoax North Korean EMP attack, mass distributed power grid terrorism network, etc.)\n4) Blame whatever convenient enemy is politically acceptable (North Korea, “the Russians,” Little Green Men or whatever it takes…).\n5) Allow the fiat currency debt pyramid to collapse and smolder until the sheeple get desperate (i.e. Venezuela-style desperation with people eating out of dumpsters).\n6) With great fanfare, announce a government-backed cryptocurrency replacement for all fiat currencies, and position world governments as the SAVIOR of humanity. Allow the desperate public to trade in their fiat currencies for official crypto currencies.\n7) Outlaw cash and criminalize gold and silver ownership by private citizens. All in the name of “security,” of course.\n8) Criminalize all non-official cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, crashing their value virtually overnight and funneling everyone into the one world government crypto, where the NSA controls the blockchain. This can easily be achieved by blaming the false flag event (see above) on some nation or group that is said to have been “funded by Bitcoin, the cryptocurrency used by terrorists.”\n9) Require embedded RFID or biometric identifiers for all transactions in order to “authenticate” the one-world digital crypto currency activities. Mark of the Beast becomes reality. No one is allowed to eat, travel or earn a wage without being marked.\n10) Once absolute control over the new one-world digital currency is achieved, weaponize the government-tracked blockchain to track all transactions, investments and commercial activities. Confiscate a portion of all crypto under the guise of “automated taxation.” In an emergency, the government can even announce negative interest rates where your holdings automatically decrease each day.\nWith all this accomplished, globalists can now roll out absolute totalitarian control over every aspect of private lives by enforcing financial “blackouts” for those individuals who criticize the government. They can put in place automatic deductions for traffic violations, vehicle license plate taxes, internet taxes and a thousand other oppressive taxes invented by the bureaucracy. With automatic deductions run by the government, citizens have no means to halt the endless confiscation of their “money” by totalitarian bureaucrats and their deep state lackeys.\n",

The $6 billion Saudi officials are demanding from Prince al-Waleed, a large stakeholder in Western businesses like Twitter, is among the highest figures they have sought from those arrested, some of the people familiar with the matter said.\"\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/articles/the-price-of-freedom-for-saudi-arabias-richest-man-6-billion-1513981887\n",

Dana Rohrabacher, California Republican, will appear before the House panel later this month to answer questions concerning his August 2017 meeting in London with Mr. Assange, the lawmaker told The Los Angeles Times.\n\n“As you can see, I am not worried,” Mr. Rohrabacher said Monday. “I have no worries at all. Once the public understands that the regular media has given them a false impression of my meetings with Russians, it’ll be fine,” he told The Times.\n\nWikiLeaks published emails throughout the 2016 election cycle belonging to both the Democratic National Committee and John Podesta, the chairman of the party’s nominee for president, Hillary Clinton.\n\nThe U.S. intelligence community has determined that the emails were initially obtained by hackers working on behalf of the Russian government, but Mr. Rohrabacher – the chair of the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Europe, Eurasia and Emerging Threats – left an Aug. 16 meeting with Mr. Assange convinced otherwise.\n\nhttps://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/dec/5/dana-rohrabacher-to-testify-before-investigators-a/\n",

(AP) &ndash; The kids did their part, but Mother Nature had the final say in scuttling the annual Christmas Day trip across the Delaware River by George Washington and his troops.\n\nOrganizers said high winds Monday prompted cancellation of the annual reenactment, which draws thousands of people to the banks of the river in Washington Crossing, Pennsylvania, and Titusville, New Jersey. The National Weather Service says winds have been gusting 45 or 50 mph or even a bit more in southeastern Pennsylvania and New Jersey.\n\nLow water levels in the river originally threatened to cancel the trip by re-enactors in their wooden Durham boats. But Philadelphia Waterborne, a nonprofit that teaches boat-building skills to middle- and high-school students, provided six handmade, 12-foot rowboats that could have made it across.\n",

The blast occurred near Marada, on the pipeline belonging to the Waha oil company, the source told Reuters.\nUnverified photos of what is said to be a plume of black smoke coming from the site of the pipeline explosion are being shared on social media.\nThe news of the Libyan blast saw oil prices spike to above $65 a barrel on Tuesday, trading close to its highest mark since mid-2015. Another factor contributing to the increase in price are the voluntary supply cuts by OPEC. Brent crude, the international benchmark for oil prices, went up 10 cents to $65.35 a barrel, while US crude added 12 cents at $58.59, Reuters reported.\nThe port of Es Sider changed hands on several occasions during the Libyan civil war, which started in 2011. It was severely damaged by the fighting, and remained closed between 2014 and 2016. This March Es Sider, which was shipping around 447,000 barrels per day when the conflict started, was recaptured by forces loyal to Libya’s eastern-based military commander, Khalifa Haftar, and resumed operations.\n",

This change results from such a review.\"\nOfficials cited several reasons for the decision: the volume of the tweet database is much bigger than it was a few years ago and the library lacks the capacity to deal with images and items other than text.\nThe library in 2010 began its tweet archive after receiving a \"gift\" from Twitter of the full database of public tweets dating from the first tweet in 2006, but has not determined when or how to make this public.\nThe archive \"will remain embargoed until access issues can be resolved in a cost-effective and sustainable manner,\" Osterberg said.\nA statement said the library from 2018 \"will continue to acquire tweets but will do so on a very selective basis\" adding that the collection will likely be \"thematic and event- based, including events such as elections, or themes of ongoing national interest, e.g. public policy.\"\nStill, it added that the 12-year archive of tweets already collected \"may prove to be one of this generation's most significant legacies to future generations.\"\nThe move prompted considerable reaction—including on Twitter.\n\"Not good,\" tweeted CNBC news associate Mariam Amin.\n\"I want every tweet to be archived. In 40 years, I want to take my granddaughter to the Library of Congress and show her the madness I dealt with as a journalist&hellip;make every tweet count.\"\nHow to choose?\nOthers questioned how the institution would determine which tweets are historically important.\nThe library \"now needs to decide which of all our tweets are a valuable record of events in public life,\" tweeted the consumer activist group Public Knowledge.\nBut the news site PoliticusUSA appeared to welcome the decision, tweeting that the library \"would be no longer be wasting its resources by trying to archive every single public post published on Twitter.\"\nSome Twitter users lamented the quality of the messaging platform and the impact of prolific tweeter Donald Trump.\n\"Trump has managed to lower the value of Twitter,\" one user wrote.\n\"Now the Library of Congress won't archive every Tweet. #sorrytwitter. That must be because most of his tweets are embarrassing to the rest of the nation.\"\nJennifer Grygiel, communications professor at Syracuse University, said the move was disappointing from an institution \"which is perceived to be the greatest library and archive in our country.\"\n\"This could lead to increased rhetoric about how there is too much user-generated social media content for companies to effectively manage or moderate,\" Grygiel told AFP\n\"Social media is not 'too big to moderate;' it takes time, money, and resources to effectively manage social media content.\"\"\n\nhttps://phys.org/ news/2017-12-library-congress-backtracks-twitter-archive.html#nRlv\n",

The global competition asks entrants to develop systems that can help humans navigate, map and search in underground locations that are normally too perilous to visit.\n\"One of the main limitations facing war fighters and emergency responders in subterranean environments is a lack of situational awareness; we often don't know what lies beneath us,\" Timothy Chung, program manager in DARPA's Tactical Technology Office (TTO), said in a statement. \"The DARPA Subterranean Challenge aims to provide previously unimaginable situational awareness capabilities for operations underground.\" \nGroups all around the world will compete to solve problems that help people navigate in unknown, treacherous subterranean conditions, where time is of the essence, according to the statement.\nTeams can compete in one of two tracks: a Systems track, to develop hardware-based solutions for a physical course, or a Virtual track, to develop software to test on a simulated course, DARPA said.\nThe final competition, which will take place in 2021, will include three challenges that involve navigating in one of three environments: a network of human-made tunnels, a subterranean municipal-transit system and a network of underground natural caves. The final event will challenge teams to navigate networks that include elements of all three environments. The grand-prize winners will take home $2 million. The deadline to apply is Jan. 18, 2018.\nThe development of robotics, biological and autonomous systems has reached a crucial juncture, with such systems now conceivable, said TTO Director Fred Kennedy.\n\"Instead of avoiding caves and tunnels, we can use surrogates to map and assess their suitability for use. Through the DARPA Subterranean Challenge, we are inviting the scientific and engineering communities — as well as the public — to use their creativity and resourcefulness to come up with new technologies and concepts to make the inaccessible accessible,\" Kennedy said in the statement.\"\n\nhttps://www.livescience.com/ 61278-darpa-wants-humans-to-navigate-underground.html\n",
